        <p> 03 May 2021 to 25 Jun 2021</p>
        <h3>Project Description:</h3>
        <p>The Intelligent Learning Management System (i-LMS) project is an attempt to invent Artificial Intelligence techniques to personalize learning by doing education. 
            We have mainly focused on course personalization in this practicum. Every module has a set of learning objectives. Learning objectives have certain attributes. The most important attribute is that the learning objectives are measurable. Why do we care if the learning objectives are measurable? Measurable learning objectives provide a very clear definition of how to measure the student learning on the learning objective. And to measure the learning of the student take assessments. The responses to assessments are mapped to a competency scale. The competency scale has the following values.<br>
            <br>
                1.Not yet - indicates that the student has not yet achieved it<br>
                <br>
                2.Approaching - indicates that the student is making progress but has not achieved it<br>
                <br>
                3.Consolidating - indicates that the student is able to answer the knowledge level question<br>
                <br>
                4.Mastery - indicates that the student is able to apply the learning objective to solve problems<br>
                <br>
                5.Exemplary - indicates that the student is fluently solving all the problems<br>
                <br>
            Putting all these concepts together, the course has modules, modules have learning objectives, students achieve the learning objectives by learning from the content provided, by answering quizzes, and by solving problems.
